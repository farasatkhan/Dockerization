## Docker Cheat Sheet

### Images

Builds a Docker image with the specified name and a Dockerfile in the current directory.
```bash
docker build -t <image_name>
```

Builds a Docker image with the specified name and a Dockerfile in the current directory, ignoring the cache.
```bash
docker build -t <image_name> . â€“no-cache
```

Lists all Docker images that are currently stored on the host.
```bash
docker images
```

Lists all Docker images that are currently stored on the host.
```bash
docker image ls
```

Removes the specified Docker image from the host.
```bash
docker rmi <image_name>
```

Removes all unused Docker images, including intermediate images, from the host.
```bash
docker image prune
```

### Docker Hub

Logs in to a Docker registry with the specified username.
```bash
docker login -u <username>
```

Pushes a Docker image with the specified name to a registry with the specified username.
```bash
docker push <username>/<image_name>
```

Searches for a Docker image with the specified name in Docker Hub or other registries.
```bash
docker search <image_name>
```

Downloads a Docker image with the specified name from a registry.
```bash
docker pull <image_name>
```

### Containers

Runs a Docker container with the specified name and image.

```bash
docker run --name <container_name> <image_name>
```

Runs a Docker container with the specified image and maps the host port to the container port.
```bash
docker run -p <host_port>:<container_port> <image_name>
```

Runs a Docker container with the specified image in detached mode.
```bash
docker run -d <image_name>
```

Starts or stops a running Docker container with the specified name.
```bash
docker start|stop <container_name>
```

Removes the specified Docker container from the host.
```bash
docker rm <container_name>
```

Executes a command in a running Docker container with the specified name and opens a terminal.
```bash
docker exec -it <container_name> sh
```

Displays the logs of a running Docker container with the specified name in real-time.
```bash
docker logs -f <container_name>
```

Displays detailed information about a Docker container with the specified name.
```bash
docker inspect <container_name>
```

Lists all running Docker containers on the host.
```bash
docker ps
```

Lists all Docker containers that are currently stored on the host.
```bash
docker ps --all
```

Displays resource usage statistics of all running Docker containers on the host.
```bash
docker container stats
```

### Docker Compose

Runs the Docker Compose in detached mode.

```bash
sudo docker-compose up -d
```

Displays the status of containers in the Docker Compose.
```bash
sudo docker-compose ps
```

Stops and removes the containers, networks, and volumes defined in the Docker Compose.
``` bash
sudo docker-compose down
